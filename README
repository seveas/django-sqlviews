Management command for creating views of multi-table models

When doing multi-table inheritance, it is somewhat annoying that you constantly
need to type INNER JOIN when accessing the data outside the django ORM, for
instance in a database shell or with external applications. This management
commands makes it easy to create views for these models that are simpler to
query.

Install: python setup.py install
Usage: 
- Add 'sqlviews' to INSTALLED_APPS 
- Run: ./manage.py sqlviews <appname>

Tested only on MySQL, bugreports or testreports for other databases are
welcome.
